# Kerberos

Kerberos, a mono-repo workspace tool. It mainly provides a workspace for developers to manage simultaneous development of multiple GIT repositories. Kerberos uses YARN WORKSPACE to manage dependencies, and it only provides more shortcuts to manipulate each git repository (cloning projects, adding projects, upgrading versions, etc.) to complete the entire development process.
